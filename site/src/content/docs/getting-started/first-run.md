The first run should either open the app or tell you exactly what is missing. No blank screens, no silent auth failure.

## Let onboarding drive

```bash
spotuify onboard
```

What you get: config creation, a browser login, and the first sync path in one flow.

The default auth path uses your own Spotify Developer app through Spotify OAuth PKCE. Add the app's `client_id` to config when onboarding asks for it. Use redirect URI `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` in the Spotify dashboard. Premium is required for playback.

This is the BYO Spotify app GA path, not broad consumer no-developer setup. If playlist/library writes return `403`, your app is probably still in Spotify Development Mode; apply for Extended Quota Mode in the Spotify dashboard.

## Inspect the config path

```bash
spotuify config path
spotuify config get redirect_uri
```

By default the config lives under the platform config directory as `spotuify/spotuify.toml`. You can point one invocation at another file:

```bash
SPOTUIFY_CONFIG=/tmp/spotuify.toml spotuify config path
```

## Run doctor before debugging the TUI

```bash
spotuify doctor --format json
```

What you get: a structured health report. Use this first for auth, daemon, device, Spotify API, cache, and log-path problems.

## Verify device control

```bash
spotuify devices --format json
spotuify transfer spotuify-hume
spotuify status
```

## Verify local cache

```bash
spotuify sync library --format json
spotuify cache status --format json
spotuify search "liked" --source local --format jsonl
```

## Open the TUI

```bash
spotuify
```

The first screen is Home: saved music, podcasts, recent plays, and a queue
panel when a Spotify session is active. If nothing is playing, Space starts the
selected Home item. Quit the TUI with `q`; the daemon and playback continue.
